<h2>Digital Innovation: Expert class - Developing a restaurant management system in REST API with Spring Boot</h2>

The following topics will be developed and addressed:

* Initial Project Setup with Spring Boot Initialzr
* Creating a data model for mapping entities into databases
* Development of restaurant management operations (Registering, reading, updating and removing restaurants from a system).
* Relation of each of the above operations with the REST architectural pattern, and the explanation of each of the REST concepts involved during project development.
* Testing Conceptual Presentation: The Test Type Pyramid, as well as the importance of each test type during the development cycle.
* Focus on unit tests: show why it is important to develop these types of tests as part of the software development cycle.
* Main frameworks for unit testing in Java: JUnit, Mockito and Hamcrest.
* Development of unit tests for validation of basic functionalities: creation, listing, query by name and restaurant exclusion.
* Cloud system deployment through Heroku

To run the project on the terminal, type the following command:

```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

After executing the above command, just open the following address and view the project execution:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/restaurants
```

The following prerequisites are necessary for the execution of the project developed:

* Java 11 or higher versions.
* Maven 3.6.3 or higher versions.
* Intellj IDEA Community Edition or your favorite IDE.
* GIT version control installed on your machine.
* GitHub account for cloud storage of your project.
* Heroku account to deploy the project to the cloud
* Willing to learn and share knowledge :)
